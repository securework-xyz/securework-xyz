## 🎯 Our Mission

**Democratize smart contract security auditing.**

Every developer deserves access to professional security tools, not just well-funded teams.

## 💡 What We're Building

SecureWork Protocol is an integrated platform combining:

## 📊 The Problem We're Solving

| Traditional Approach | SecureWork Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Audits cost $20k-$100k | Continuous auditing from $1-2k |
| Security checks after development | Security integrated during development |
| Freelance platforms charge 10-20% | Platform fee: 2.5% |
| Centralized dispute resolution | DAO-based governance |

**Result:** 70%+ of small projects launch without proper security → $2B+ lost to preventable exploits annually
