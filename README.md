## 💡 What We're Building

SecureWork Protocol is an integrated platform that brings together:

🔹 **Freelance Escrow** - Milestone-based payments with automated smart contract releases  
🔹 **Bug Bounty Marketplace** - Continuous security auditing during development  
🔹 **Unified Reputation** - On-chain credentials for developers and auditors  

### The Problem We're Solving

- **Expensive Audits**: Professional audits cost $20k-$100k, excluding 70% of projects
- **Broken Platforms**: Centralized freelance platforms charge 10-20% fees with poor dispute resolution
- **Reactive Security**: Teams only audit after development, when fixes are 10x more expensive

### Our Solution

Integrate security directly into the development process:
- Clients create milestone-based projects with 5-10% automatically allocated to bug bounties
- Developers build and earn while security researchers audit in parallel
- Everyone pays just 2.5% platform fee (vs 20% on Web2 platforms)
